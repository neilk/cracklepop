## About the solution

Yes, it's a joke. I hope you like it?

[A few years ago](https://x.com/NeilKNet/status/1357738719759896577), I decided to make a ridiculous Fizzbuzz implementation, that used ECMAScript 6, fit in a tweet, and had no assignments. I adapted it here for CracklePop, with more descriptive variable names and a few other improvements.

Minified it comes in at 190 characters.

## Specifications

> Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print 
> Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print
> CracklePop. You can use any language.

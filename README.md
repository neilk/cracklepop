# CracklePop

For my Recurse Center application, 2024-08-30

## Instructions

Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.

## About the solution

[A few years ago](https://x.com/NeilKNet/status/1357738719759896577), I decided to try making a ridiculous Fizzbuzz implementation, that used ECMAScript 6, fit in a tweet, and had no assignments. I adapted it here for CracklePop.
